,? TODD'S PRE-GAME READ,,,
,"To achieve elite performance and dominance (characterized by a 55%+ rally win rate and a 5.0+ skill level), several specific shot selection adjustments are required to transition from a ""banger mentality"" to a tactically disciplined game.",,,
,,,,
,1. Shift from Aggression to Patience,,,
,,,,
,"Elite dominance is built on the fact that longer rallies favor the disciplined player; data shows winning rallies average 7.3 shots, while losing rallies average 6.6.",,,
,,,,
,1?? The 70/30 Rule: Implement a selection framework where 70% of shots are high-percentage and only 30% are aggressive opportunities.,,,
,,,,
,"2?? Outcome Detachment: You must release the attachment to hitting ""perfect winners"" and instead choose high-percentage plays that systematically build the point.",,,
,,,,
,"3?? Cooperative Driving: Instead of trying to ""rip"" third-shot winners, view the drive as a tool to force a weak return, mentally ""begging"" the opponent to return the ball so you can hit a fifth-shot drop and move to the kitchen.",,,
,,,,
,2. Strategic Shot Ratios,,,
,,,,
,Dominance requires rebalancing your shot distribution to prioritize net control over baseline aggression:,,,
,,,,
,"1?? Drive-to-Dink Ratio: Adjust from current levels (roughly 1.38:1 or 1.6:1) to a 1:1 or 0.8:1 ratio, emphasizing more dinks to establish net dominance.",,,
,,,,
,"2?? Third Shot Selection: Shift to a pattern of 60% drops and 40% drives. The default should be a drop unless the opponent provides a clearly attackable, short return.",,,
,,,,
,"3?? Reset Integration: Elite players must bridge the ""defensive gap"" by developing a reset shot. The target is to increase reset attempts to at least 2.0 per game (up from 0.32) or 40+ attempts over a 12-game span.",,,
,,,,
,3. Technical Adjustments for Error Control,,,
,,,,
,Dominance is often determined by error management rather than winner production. Nearly 50% of errors occur because shots are hit either into the net or long.,,,
,,,,
,"The ""Punch vs. Brush"" Framework:",,,
,"1?? Dinks/Drops/Resets: Use a PUNCH (push, no topspin) to ensure consistency.",,,
,,,,
,2?? Drives/Attacks: Use a BRUSH (topspin) to keep the ball in play.,,,
,,,,
,"3?? Targeting ""Safe Zones"": Aim for 3 feet inside the baseline on deep shots and maintain a 6?12 inch net clearance on soft shots to eliminate ""unforced"" errors.",,,
,,,,
,"4?? Absorbing Pace: When attacked, the adjustment is to ""receive the ball"" with soft hands (resets) rather than fighting the pace with a counter-attack, which carries high error risk.",,,
,,,,
,4. Implementation of Signature Patterns,,,
,,,,
,Elite performance is characterized by the ability to execute specific tactical sequences reliably under pressure.,,,
,,,,
,"1?? Drop and Attack: Using a third-shot drop specifically to facilitate a move to the kitchen, followed by patient dinking until an attackable ball is presented.",,,
,,,,
,"2?? Serve and Surge: Using a deep serve to force a weak return, allowing for an aggressive fourth shot and a poach at the net.",,,
,,,,
,"3?? Reset and Rebuild: Successfully neutralizing an opponent?s pace with a reset shot to ""re-establish"" kitchen positioning and return the point to a neutral state.",,,
